title: "검찰 수사에 압력 넣은 살아있는 권력.. 공수처 설치 명분 '흔들'"
---

29일 법조계는 검찰을 향한 문 대통령의 경고성 발언을 놓고 공수처에도 대통령의 직·간접적인 수사지시가 내려올 수 있다는 것을 보여준 사례라고 평가하는 분위기다. 국회에는 공수처 설치 등을 골자로 하는 ‘검찰개혁’ [법안이 패스트트랙(신속처리안건)으로 올라 있다](https://naver.com). 그동안 `공수처 설치`는 검찰개혁의 최우선 과제로 꼽혔다. 정치권 등을 중심으로 검찰의 수사가 공정하고 객관적이지 못하다는 목소리가 끊임없이 나왔고, 검찰이 살아있는 권력 앞에 유독 약한 모습을 보여왔다는 지적도 함께 제기됐다. 문 대통령이 윤석열 검찰총장에게 임명장을 수여하며 “살아있는 권력에도 엄정해야 한다”고 당부한 것도 이 때문이다.

```js
import Typography from "typography"
import parnassusTheme from "typography-theme-parnassus"
const typography = new Typography(parnassusTheme)
export const { scale, rhythm, options } = typography
export default typography
```

## Cool story. But why?

### Performance
With the markup being rendered at build-time, there is no server runtime to generate the markup. The HTML files are already there ready to be sent over to the client. Granted the performance gains here aren’t groundbreaking as most web server implementations utilize page caching, but any gains to time to first byte is a plus.

### Cost
Again, since there’s no server runtime and all that’s being served are some static assets, the assets can be stored on and served from a CDN. Meaning costs to deploy your site are low and with some services like Netlify (which we’ll cover later) can even be free.

### SEO
Generally speaking, you want web crawlers to have an as easy of a job as possible indexing your website. Amongst other reasons, this is why implementing server-side rendering or pre-rendering on your single-page-application is a plus. This way, web crawlers don’t have to wait for javascript to be parsed and ran before the markup can be indexed, the markup will already exist inside the HTML file. This is not to say SPAs are not crawled by search engines, however, there are edge cases that make it difficult.

### Developer experience
> With the backend services abstracted away into their own APIs, the front-end engineer has free reign over what tools, libraries, frameworks, and languages to utilize on the front-end. There are no restriction on what preprocessed languages or build tools can be used as the case with some web frameworks. Personally, I think the tools the Node.js community have developed are second to none when it comes to DX. Tools like Webpack have enabled things like Hot Module Replacement. I know and love the development workflow Node.js projects have to offer and often find myself longing for those tools when working on projects with what I consider inferior development tooling.
